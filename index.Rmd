## About Me:

I am a graduate student at NC State's Institute for Advanced Analytics who is passionate about all things Data Science. I have an Bachelor's degree in Economics with a minor in Data Science from Macalester College located in St. Paul, MN. I have about 4 years worth of experience in R, of which I used to create this website you're on right now! I am also familiar with Python, and have dabbled in using Tableau.

I am an alumni of the Macalester Varsity Men's Soccer Team, where I fine tuned my skills as a leader and a great teammate. I have played many different sports including Basketball, Tennis and Hockey. I get very excited combining my love for sports and data analytics!
