The NHL season came to a close exactly a week ago today, and I would be a petty fan if I didn't admire how well both the Florida Panthers and the Vegas Golden Knights played to get to the Stanley Cup Finals. As a Sabres fan, a part of me enjoyed watching a few Buffalo alumni find success in the postseason, including Sam Reinhart, Brandon Montour, and yes, Jack Eichel. Although it was tough seeing Jack raise the cup only a year since leaving Buffalo, I was glad that he is now getting the recognition he deserves as one of the league's best playmakers. As for Florida, I was continuously stunned to watch them take down the giants of the East. Around Matthew Tkachuk, who I believe is in the conversation for the current best American-born player, the Panthers rallied together during the Boston series and never looked back. It is exciting to think that my Sabres finished only one point behind the Panthers after the regular season, though I don't think Buffalo has the roster yet to make such a deep run. However, now that the season is over, General Manager Kevyn Adams should have the time and ability to find Buffalo the few pieces they need to become a real contender. Between a loaded prospect pool and a number of future high draft picks, the Sabres have plenty to play with to strike a deal, and it seems like the first thing on their list is to find Owen Power his Top-4 defensive partner.

It was reported on Thursday, June 15, that the Sabres have shown interest in Carolina Hurricanes defenseman Brett Pesce. If the Canes aren't able to find an extension agreement with Pesce, Buffalo should be looking to make an offer. After hearing the news, my immediate reaction was that he would be the perfect complement to Power. Pesce is 28 years old and entering his ninth season in the league. Standing at 6 feet 3 inches and shooting right-handed, Pesce has the physical qualities of a valuable top-4 defenseman. He also has the immediate playoff experience that the Sabres lack as a youthful team. Pesce scored 5 goals and had 30 points in the 2022-23 season, which coincidentally is very similar to Power's performance. At surface level, this is a player the Sabres should be excited to pursue this offseason. However, what do the analytics say about this rumor? Are there any other players Buffalo might want to keep an eye on as well? In this post, I aim to answer these questions using simple clustering and data visualization techniques.

##Clustering
I started by collecting statistics for every defenseman from the 2022-23 season. Thanks to MoneyPuck, one of my favorite websites, this process was seamless. The dataset included every skater who played a minute in the league, so I filtered it to only include defensive skaters. As a result, I had 334 observations, including statistics such as cumulative Expected Goals For, Takeaways, and Hits. I wanted to focus more on the play style of the player rather than the number of points they had this past season, so I removed any metrics related to points. This was the extent of the preprocessing that I thought was necessary before diving into the modeling.

I decided to take advantage of k-Means clustering for this project because of the data versatility the algorithm can handle. After scaling the data, I found the optimal number of clusters (by decreasing within sum of squares) to be 5 groups.

Cluster 1 - Newcomers & Rotational Bottom Line Defensemen: This cluster included 62 players with names such as Arber Xhekaj, Bowen Byram, and Adam Boqvist who are just starting to get acclimated to the league. This group also included some players who could likely see another team next year, such as Buffalo's own Jacob Bryson. This cluster was ranked last in every summary statistic I had evaluated.

Cluster 2 - "Stay at Home" Defensemen: These players are your typical hard hitting grinders who do the intangibles but might not get all the same recognition of those joining up on the attack. Of the 109 players seen in this cluster, some of the names assigned to this group include Radko Gudas, Matt Dumba, and Alec Martinez who coincidentally scored what seemed to be the dagger in Game 5 against Florida last week. This group had the largest average number of hits per games played. Also, of the clusters that played on average more than 70 games this past season, this group had the smallest Expected Goals Against per Game. 

Cluster 3 - Norris Trophy Potential: This was by far the smallest cluster, only including 9 players. These players contributed to the point sheet immensely for their teams this season, and if not directly, their play style created a lot of the puck movement. The defensemen in this cluster are; Aaron Ekblad, Brent Burns, Roman Josi, Rasmus Dahlin, Josh Morrissey, Dougie Hamilton, Erik Karlsson, Brandon Montour, and Miro Heiskanen. I think it's important to note that I clustered the data prior to removing goals, assists, and secondary assists, and Cale Makar was a part of this list as well. This group averaged the largest Expected Goals For, Takeaways, and High Danger Chances per Game. These are your "Unicorns". 

Cluster 4 - True Top-4 "Two Way" Defensemen: This is the cluster we are most interested in because it contains our player of interest, Owen Power. These 42 players excel on both sides of the ice. On average, these players create just 0.07 Expected Goals For per game less than Cluster 5, while allowing 0.08 less Expected Goals Against per game than Cluster 5 as well. This is my "Goldilocks" cluster because the players are not too hot not too cold, but great at what they do on both sides. Within this cluster, there are individuals such as Victor Hedman, Alex Pietrangelo, and yes of course, Brett Pesce.

Cluster 5 - Healthy Scratches, 7th Defensemen, AHL Call-Ups: Although this cluster was the largest of the groups, these defensemen on average only played in 9.9 games this season. Most of their time was either spent in the AHL, on IR, or in the NCAA. Some names in this cluster include Casey Fitzgerald, Jamie Drysdale, and Brock Faber.

##Pesce?
I don't think it was by chance that Brett Pesce ended up being a part of that "Two Way" Defensemen cluster along with Owen Power. A huge advantage of implementing a clustering technique, is that you can easily find players that have similar styles of play. If you watch the two on TV, you may have been able to guess that they'd both be in the same cluster, but it's even more ensuring realizing that the analytics behind their play also agrees. Once you dive deeper into the cluster, you can find which players are even better compliments to each other based on where they fall within the group. What better way to see the spectrum of players than to visualize the cluster.

Each of the visualizations that I chose to create contained an offensive statistic along the x-axis and a defensive statistic along the y-axis.

```{r, fig.align='center',echo=FALSE, fig.height=1, fig.width=1}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\littl\\OneDrive\\Documents\\Advanced Data Sci\\Wagner_website\\_Posts\\2023-06-19-dmanclustering\\takeaways vs. xG.png")
``` 

Owen Power, represented in Sabres gold, falls around the middle of the cluster at just over 8 Expected Goals for the season and just under 25 takeaways in '22-'23. Brett Pesce can be seen highlighted in red. As you can see, Pesce is not the only player highlighted in the scatter plot. The 26 year old Calgary Flames Defensemen, Noah Hanifin could be a potential alternative option for Buffalo to target during this offseason if Pesce resigns to Carolina. Reports have surfaced that although Calgary is working to extend some of their 2024 free agents, Hanifin is not sold on extending his time with the Flames.  

```{r, fig.align='center',echo=FALSE, fig.height=1, fig.width=1}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\littl\\OneDrive\\Documents\\Advanced Data Sci\\Wagner_website\\_Posts\\2023-06-19-dmanclustering\\High Danger for and Against.png")
``` 

Owen Power likes to take some risks in order to gain an offensive edge as seen in his statistics. Adding Pesce would allow Power to take said risks with the assurance that his pair would cover when he gets up in the attack. In the plot above, Power is shown in the top right corner of the graph with other defensemen who gain a lot of high danger scoring chances, but also give up a lot of high danger chances as well. Pesce, located in the bottom left, represents a great option to stay at home and decrease any casualties that might occur on a counter attack.

Hanifin is just about even with Pesce at the number of High Danger scoring chances against when he is on the ice, but also at just about the same number of high danger chances for as Power. In this visualization Hanifin looks like the best of both worlds. However, it's important to make note that Hanifin shoots with his left hand, which would make head coach Don Granato's job a little more challenging, as Power also is a lefty. 

```{r, fig.align='center',echo=FALSE, fig.height=1, fig.width=1}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\littl\\OneDrive\\Documents\\Advanced Data Sci\\Wagner_website\\_Posts\\2023-06-19-dmanclustering\\giveaways vs xG Created.png")
``` 

Finally, Brett Pesce shows a lot more maturity with the puck than either of the two younger players highlighted. Pesce has the second fewest D-Zone Giveaways than any player in his cluster (just behind Minnesota's veteran Jared Spurgeon). Adding a smart, low risk player might be exactly what the Sabre's need for this ultra young D-Core. However, if they are looking to add onto their scoring success from last season while not risking too much, Noah Hanifin seems like a great second option they should be targeting this summer.

It seems like the Buffalo Sabres have a few key holes they need to address. Of course there are doubts about goaltending, and if Devon Levi is ready to take over as the starter quite yet. However, a huge piece that seemed to stare us fans in the face each night was a solid Top-4 Defensemen who could be relied on to reign in the energy and excitement of the youngest group in the league. After looking at the data, I am all in on the Cane's defensemen and I hope the Sabres act on the rumors currently being tossed around on Twitter.
