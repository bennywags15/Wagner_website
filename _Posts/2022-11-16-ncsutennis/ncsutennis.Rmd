Over the last five months I have been enrolled at NC State University chasing my Master's degree in Data Analytics at the Institute for Advanced Analytics. Since the start of the program I have been part of many projects, but this was by far my favorite experience that I have been a part of here in Raleigh. I grew up playing tennis for many years, so my expertise was incredibly helpful to the team's success. Thus, I'm excited to show off the interactive dashboards a team of peers and I have created for Assistant Coach Secker and the Women's Tennis Team here at State!

The team and I was provided a dataset containing values measured at a point by point level for each of the matches the team participated in over the seasons 2018/2019 up to this past season, 2021/2022. These included indicators relaying whether the player's first serve was in, which type of shot won the point, and if the final shot of the point was a winner. Using this data, the team and I calculated many useful metrics within Tableau which related to each player and the team overall. Creating these calculated fields was by far the most difficult step in this projects process as the data was not particularly the cleanest. It took the team and I some time to understand the strategies used by those who collected the data.

From there, the team and I began to create multiple dashboards containing visualizations that were specified by the coaching staff. In total, we made 5 different interfaces including; a player specific dashboard, a team leaderboard, Time Oriented Trends, an Indoor vs. Outdoor comparison, and a Match Win vs. Loss comparison. These are all listed on the Tableau homepage, which allows the user to navigate between each of these boards. Within each of these dashboards, the user is allowed to filter various information such as which player they are looking at visualizations for or which season they want to view specifically. 

This was not the first time the Institute was called upon by the coaching staff. The team uses the dashboards that past classes have created to attack areas of improvement within the team and to show recruits the resources the team has to improve their own game. As a former college athlete, hearing that my work would be used for real development motivated me to put my best effort into the project. At first I was hesitant because this was my first time creating anything in Tableau. However, I am so proud of the final product both aesthetically and functionally. I feel like a learned a ton in Tableau and I'm excited to make even more effective dashboards! Thank you for all you support.
